APIs are the backbone of communication over the Internet. Well-designed APIs behave consistently, are predictable, and grow without friction. Some best practices to keep in mind are as follows:

1 - Use Clear Naming: When building an API, choose straightforward and logical names. Be consistent and stick with intuitive URLs that denote collections. 

2 - Idempotency: APIs should be idempotent. They ensure safe retries by making repeated requests to produce the same result, especially for POST operations.

3 - Pagination: APIs should support pagination to prevent performance bottlenecks and payload bloat. Some common pagination strategies are offset-based and cursor-based.

4 - Sorting and Filtering: Query strings are an effective way to allow sorting and filtering of API responses. This makes it easy for developers to see what filters and sort orders are applied. 

5 - Cross Resource References: Use clear linking between connected resources. Avoid excessively long query strings that make the API harder to understand. 

6 - Rate Limiting: Rate limiting is used to control the number of requests a user can make to an API within a certain timeframe. This is crucial for maintaining the reliability and availability of the API. 

7 - Versioning: When modifying API endpoints, proper versioning to support backward compatibility is important. 

8 - Security: API security is mandatory for well-designed APIs. Use proper authentication and authorization with APIs using API Keys, JWTs, OAuth2, and other mechanisms.
